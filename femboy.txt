[22:36] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: In that case... I could have a duplication/multiplication power~ I can create copies of people I 'know' and even make subtle changes to their physique.
[22:37] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: To balance it out, these copies are as strong as 'me' but for each copy that's present, all of 'us' become twice as sensitive to our weaknesses.

[22:47] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: Hypnotic Touch. Using some manner of sexual contact, you can try to seduce someone into doing your will. Whether you succeed or fail, though, you become more sensitive to whatever you did for the power to activate. Say you tried to activate it with a kiss, you become more sensitive to kissing.
[22:47] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: Say you tried to activate it with a handjob, you become more sensitive to fingering, etc.

[22:49] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: Alright, so we have Hypnotic Touch and Multiplication.
[22:50] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: Hypnotic Touch leaves the user more sensitive to whatever they attempted as means for their power. Multiplication leaves the user and clones more sensitive to their weaknesses.

[23:10] [user]Kenia Nya[/user]: So, no stats, just dice rolling, we both roll a d20 and the difference gets dealt. But, if one of us tries to activate a power, that's a d20 roll against a stock difficulty
[23:02] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: If you roll 15 and I roll 10, your attack goes through and does 5 damage.
[23:02] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: If you roll 15 and I roll 20, I choose whether the attack goes through and damages you 5, or I counter in some way for 5 damage.

[23:23] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: When you roll for your skill, the outcome is dictated by the number you get.
20: Critical success. Your skill works like a charm and you suffer no drawbacks.
16-19: Excellent. Your skill activates at full power.
11-15: Great. Your skill activates, but the effects aren't as good as they could be.
6-10: Barely. A very weak version activates, easily disposed of.
2-5: Fail. The skill doesn't activate.
1: Critical failure. Your skill backfires on you. You suffer both the effects and the drawbacks.
