[color=cyan][b]Ryuutama[/b][/color] is a Japanese tabletop RPG, focused more on story, player interaction and adventure than combat. It has combat, yes, but it centers on the trips and misteries of the world... If you're interested in giving it a try, please let me know ([user]Kenia Nya[/user]) and once we have a couple of people interested, we can start a quick game...
I implemented the character creation with the bot, first, you have to use the command !register, the bot will give you a quick explanation of the different steps to create your character... Once you're done, you can see page one of your sheet with !sheet1, page two with !sheet2 or your whole character sheet with just !sheet. I'm working on buying selling items (so it's not done yet) but you can see the current shops with !weapons and !armor, also, if you want to try the dice rolling, you can do !roll str+dex+1 (or whatever stats and bonuses are required) I hope we can have a lot of fun soon!
Room for sheets and other stuff! (So we don't spam the main room) [session=Adventure Online! (sheets and other stuff)]adh-e6b3926912c9ad9105f8[/session]
