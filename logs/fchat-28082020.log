Doesn't feel so good to get bullied yourself, does it!" This particular goblin hadn't even interacted with her up until now, but... She had to get her revenge somehow! "Just say sorry, and let all your goblin friends know that i'm not their pet! And you'll get your hat back!"

28-08-2020 00:29:19.7 [ROOM] The Greenskins: /me huffed harder and harder... before going to smirk.. she had an idea.. Trixie was quick on her head and moved to point at her hat. "Well.. I'll say it.. but first, I put your dollar in my hat. You can have it back." She'd say as she actually did put it in there, but Trixie had another plan in mind.. if she put her hand in that hat she'd reach into the pocket dimension.. and Trixie would use her animated rope in it to instead wrap around her to tangle her up! "It'll be my gift to you for bullying you before I apologize~"
28-08-2020 00:34:39.8 [ROOM] Amane Kanata: /me gave a smug grin! "See? Isn't that easy? You just gotta be kind to people~" She took the hat off and reached into it, only to feel that spark of an igniting spell! "What are you- AH!" She squeaks as rope flies out of the hat like silly string, animating itself to absolutely mummify Kanata's body, leaving her with just her head outside of the confines of the fibre prison! "Gh! N-not again! Nngha!" She tried to struggle, but all of her spells required a flick of the wrist or some kind of movement, and with her entire body bound she was utterly, completely helpless! She began falling out of the sky!
28-08-2020 00:38:18.4 [ROOM] Maylinn: hola
28-08-2020 00:40:40.5 [ROOM] The Greenskins: /me once Amane was being tied up Trixie was already on it, she knew what'd happen next, she'd fall! So she quickly pointed at the ground under Amaneas she did a quick incantion.. and teleport'd in... Goppy! "Head's up~" She'd say before Goppy had enough time to look up before. [b]BAP[/b] the two collided into the heap! At least Goppy was there in time to pretty much cushion her fall but it'd probably leave them both woozy! Goppy was a tough goblin though and was just rubbing her head with swirly eyes.
28-08-2020 00:40:58.2 [ROOM] Styx Shadow master: hola

28-08-2020 00:44:06.6 [ROOM] Amane Kanata: /me gasped as she was about to hit the ground, giving a bit of a grumble after the impact, looking around to realise she was face-to-dazzled face with another new goblin! Unable to defend herself at all, she just laid there with a large pout across her lips and bided her time... There'd surely be another opportunity to escape yet! This witch was probably just after the rest of her money!
28-08-2020 00:47:12.2 [ROOM] Ryusei the Noivern: /me echo un rapido vistazo
28-08-2020 00:49:13.1 [ROOM] The Greenskins: /me Goppy recovered shortly before she moved to sit up and rub her head. Trixie walked over and immediately took her hat back.. but not the rope, she left that around Amane while smirking at her. 
"What? Have some bad experiences with our kin? I head we were breeding someone who can fly in here." She'd grumble while stil smiling as Goppy huffed at Trixie but didn't complain while speaking up.
"Who even.. is this.. why'd you take her hat? She's touchy about it.."
28-08-2020 00:52:12.8 [ROOM] Amane Kanata: /me gets a little... shakey. Her voice shakes as she realised she was probably the one in the wrong here. "Ah... I just, needed to... v-vent some frustrations against your tribe! You attacked me a buncha times already in s-super unfair ways!" She was already blushing as the two girls looked down at her

28-08-2020 00:59:39.6 [ROOM] The Greenskins: /me Trixie'd huff before adjusting her hat and leaning on her one boot that also looked like a stocking, yea only one boot. "Well I'd normally let this go but you grabbed my hat.. that's a big no-no for anyone." She'd say before smiling at Goppy. "Let's teach her a lesson~" She'd say as Goppy just pulled Amane into her lap.. she was sitting up and Amane was tied up.. made sense to Goppy!
"Are we going to spank her and rob her money?" She'd say in confusion as Trixie giggled and shook her head. "Oh no.. How about we just use her body.. she sounds use to it~ Could do other things if we have to!"
28-08-2020 01:03:17.3 [ROOM] Amane Kanata: /me whimpered a little as she pulled onto those [b]bigg[/b] thighs. "Wah... I am NOT used to it! D-don't you goblins ever get bored of just mindlessly shoving things into holes? S-sounds pretty one-note to me!" The tenshi's gambit to get out of another rough fucking sounded more like she was just asking for something kinkier. She looked around, and between the two goblins. She was utterly trapped, and wasn't going to get much of a say either way at this point, but she still was desperately searching for an opportunity!
28-08-2020 01:08:39.4 [ROOM] The Greenskins: /me Trixie'd laugh beore going to bend over her as Goppy held her there on her big thighs. She was mostly resting her head and... rope body on her lap while she pat her head calmly. Goppy was pretty lax when not.. dicking people. 
Trixie though had a glint in her eyes as she leered her red gaze into Amane's. "Is that so? You think that's one-note? Hm~ Well then.. how about we do something else this time? And if not.... we can put two cocks.. in your butt.. so something else.. or two in your little rump.. yea~?"
28-08-2020 01:13:25.7 [ROOM] Amane Kanata: /me was hit with a pretty intense contrast, that hand through her hair soothing her soul and making her almost accept her place, only to be hit with such an obscene idea! "T-two in... H-hey! No! I can barely handle one up there! I don't wanna be dicked at all!" She huffs a little, but that head stroking quickly loosened up that tight expression. "Mmph... Can't you just let me go? I won't... take your hat again"

She'd add before grinning ever so deviously. "Ten minutes max.. and if you hold out, we'll let you go.. I'll even give you ten buck~" Sounds like a good deal.. hold out ten minutes and she was free, right? [sub]except it was a gambling addicted goblin who was striking the deal with her[/sub]
28-08-2020 01:26:49.1 [ROOM] Amane Kanata: /me gives a relieved sigh "Fuwah... Ten minutes... Easy!" She gave a big smile again, ready to earn that money! "Easiest ten bucks i'll ever make! I get to just sit back and enjoy myself, and then deny you both at the end of it~" She chuckles to herself, wondering why the goblin would offer her such a silly deal that hinged on something as unchanging as her consent!

Trixie was a risk taker.. but then she'd moved to flick her fingers with he right hand, her middle finger and thumb as her clothes, aside that hat, and Goppy's clothes teleported off to a nearby pile. Making Amane rest her head on Goppy's lap, right on her cock as Trixie grinned. Pulling out a small sand glass clock.. before tipping it upside down.. the sand falling down at an infinitesimally slow rate. "Time start's now~" She'd say before walking over to Amane as she then stated to slowly run her hands over Amane's rope.. she was.. casting a spell but it seemed like she was focusing as her hands slowly glowed in a teal-like hue. "I'll get you nice and ready... soon too~" She'd coo as her hands traced over Amane's chest briefly.

28-08-2020 01:56:59.9 [ROOM] The Greenskins: /me giggled as Goppy was starting to get aroused, she was already some what firm herself but now she was rigid while she moved to grab Amane's head. "Time to help.. we are a team~!" Goppy's say with cheery enthusiasm.. but then clamped her hand over Amane's mouth.. then just pulled her head towards Goppys cock and [b]pulled[/b] her head against her balls.. keeping her mouth covered so she had no choice but the take a loud mouthful of those sweaty nut filled balls.. reminding of her thick thick fuck musk~
All while Trixie moved to narrowed her eyes, focusing as she trailed her hands over Amane's crotch area a few more times. "Six taught me... this one.. see some species.. go into heat... this is a way of.. impressing it's effects on people who can't go into heat~" She'd tease.. and let her realize what was about to happen as a tingly sensation started to flutter in the pit of her stomach.. then the euphoria started to grow into her mind, the sheer smell of those balls trailing the pleasure no doubt down her spine right to her pussy with every huff, it did seem a few minutes were down though! Heck she might even be halfway already!

28-08-2020 02:04:19.0 [ROOM] Amane Kanata: /me was so utterly blindsided by all the different forms of pleasure attacking her at once that she would've tapped out if she had access to her hands. She would've screamed for mercy if she wasn't being pacified by that hand, and she would've came already if that buzzer wasn't intentionally keeping her just on the edge. That overwhelming pleasure was being dangled in front of her as her nose dugs right between those balls, forced to take in the musk that had ruined her so many times before now. She already knew she wouldn't make it now, and she knew exactly what the two were planning. Keep her drugged up until a few seconds were left and then give her just enough air to beg like a slut. She felt everything else slipping away. She had about ten seconds left of conscious, rational thought. Just considering that took up about half of her remaining clarity, and before she knew it... She was an utter whore again, ugly snorting noises coming from that nutsack as the angel's purity was melted away from her once more. All she could do now was enjoy the sensations rolling through her body, bucking against every movement as if she could trick the spells into giving her an early orgasm. Now it was just a matter of the girls deciding when they wanted to let up on the torture and let the girl surrender

28-08-2020 02:15:49.9 [ROOM] Shallow punch: /me casually ripped of her flannel shirt leaving her C-cups to bounce free as she leaned against the railing winking at her ponyopponent.*
28-08-2020 02:16:26.2 [ROOM] The Greenskins: /me Goppy kept her hand on her mouth.. it was nice to hear her give in as she finally started huffing thick sniffs of her nuts while she giggled.. while Trixie by contrast was grinning oh so widely. Looking like a satisfied deviant. Trixie kept watching the time.. waiting until her surmised there was maybe a minute left.. maybe.. before she finally waved her hands... the vibrator disappearing, the mage hands on her breasts going away.. the ropes pulling back up into Trixie's hat and Goppy.. after seeing this let go of Amane's head. Taking away all her stimulation after edging her for several minutes to see how she'd feel once all her pleasure was taken and she could finally use her mouth instead of huffing those nuts in thick dirty, and frankly embarrassing snorts on those musky balls~
"So.. do you want to fuck now?" Trixie'd coo in a near honeyed tone to see just how this addle brained woman would respond now that she wasn't being stimulated anymore~
28-08-2020 02:17:06.9 [ROOM] The Greenskins: Ah, she's gonna fuck her again, probably the pussy this time~?

28-08-2020 02:17:57.8 [ROOM] Sarisha Malond: /me didn't even bother to wear her uniform, just walking her naked self into the ring with Shallow. She would turn over and spread her pussy lips, bend over slightly "I'm going to trust you to follow our rules~" She'd jam her thumb within, visibly stirring her dripping wet folds "Beat me and this is aaaaaallll yours~"

Her foreskin slipping back and forth as her fat balls dangled below her.* Oh i will~ But it's nice of you to already stretch your cunt for after the match~*Shallow replied winking. Stopping right behind her she rubbed her massive member in between Sari's thighs. Teasing the huge mare and making her feel the possesive dominant member against her fur.*

28-08-2020 02:23:49.0 [ROOM] Amane Kanata: /me was in an absolute haze when she finally was able to respond and move on her own accord again. Everything ached. She felt like she was missing a vital part of herself. When she saw it, she knew exactly what it was, her body moving on its own towards Goppy's lap. She'd kneel right in front of the girl and start just pouring out her stream of consciousness to the two girls, her pure desires and fantasies aired out in the open "You win... I lost so hard, you deserve more than to just take me here... Y-you should take me home and mount me somewhere... Maybe on a chair... in the toilets... somewhere I can be useful... Using my face as a footrest... a sweatrag... a meatshield for all the lewd monsters you fight... Fuck, nngh... I wanna be fucked, b-but I wanna deserve it... earn it... I wanna be a good goblin pet! Leash me!" She was drooling straight onto Goppy's lap now, eyes wide- pinned to those steaming hot balls.
28-08-2020 02:25:52.5 [ROOM] Sarisha Malond: /me looked down at Shallow's dick popping between her legs, her pussy lips drooling along it's heated length. She brought her thighs together in a clap and rocked forward, biting her own lip trying not to get off on the sensation. "We just started and you're hard as a rock...." Sari mused bringing her thighs clapping back against the amazon's balls

28-08-2020 02:52:06.4 [ROOM] Shallow punch: /me leaned over her for a bit. Her hand still wrapped around the horse she was fapping herfeverishly by now. The blonde Shemale was hard as well. Biting her lip and panting shallow was just as eager to claim her as Sari wanted to be hers.* Just cum for me~*Shallow moaned into her Ear. Slowly she shifted. With the huge horse in Position shallow just sat down on her back. Riding her as if Sari was nothing but a common hors as shallows hand SMACKED down. Landing hard on Sari's cheek and leaving a bright red imprint on the asscheek that was soon to get branded by her owner.*

Shallow punch made Sarisha Malond cum! They both win $5.00, kinda anti-climactic if you ask me. I mean, why does the loser still get $5.00? Ah well.

Even bigger than shallow but now she was tzhe blondes' bitch. Slowly she leaned forward. Her hard cock latching on to the eager little cunt. Lining up as her fat tip spread that hungry cunt open. Pushing into her deeper and deeper as the shemale moaned in pleasure claiming sari as her trophyslut.*

Sari made like a good breeding tool and wriggled herself closer, propping onto on elbow to help keep herself spread. Every thrust nearly made her lose balance from the force! "Nnnggnnngggnnnghhh~" She'd cry to the rhythm

Thrust after thrust shallow just slammed into the greedy whorse.* You make for a nice fucktoy~*Shallow moaned out. Her firm body kept on slamming into those soft asscheeks. Thrust after thrust she just hammered in here. Her fat member eventually bottoming out deep inside the mare as he began to twitch and pump. Shallows moans growing louder as her prec lubed up the needy slut.*

Her fat cock already pumping and twitching as shallow finally came. Her cock pumped more and more of that slimy warm cum deep into Sarisha. Some warm Loads even pumped directly into the whorses womb as shallows member kept on pumping and twitching allowing the blonde to breed the whorse properly.*

Mary unable to [b]not[/b] feel the heat of their slick pussies.. or the tender warmth of each green ass as they molded around her cock. "On two... One.. [b]two~![/b]" The kin in sync already as they rose their ass and dropped it.. in [sub]plapplap[b]plaps[/b][/sub] of two asses just grinding on that cock from tip to balls.. smearing her own premature cum on her own dick with their asses~

I grip the couch as I beg, trying my damndest to hold back my impending load while I moan and writhe under your control. My cock nearly vibrating it's throbbing so hard, and the precum dripping like a faucet. "Oh goddess, it's too good!" 
28-08-2020 04:39:41.6 [ROOM] Blair Royce: /me smiles as she sees the pleasure washing over her opponents body, she did notice that he reached down as well but when she felt it, he was as nearly as gentle with her balls "Owww, that's no way to treat a woman! I guess I'll have to teach you how to play nice." She grabbed his balls as well but not putting any pressure on them, no just simply a warning. She leans in and plants a kiss on his lips and held his chin close with her free hand not giving him much choice in the matter. She follows up with several more smooches and pulls away "There think you can do that, I'm promise it will be fun if you are gentle" she blushes slightly trying to soften up Jade.

Looking underneath red, a dark ring, marked with cursed runes held tight at the base of my cock. "Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck NO!" I panic at the sight of the cursed ring, still having not cum, but dripping precum

"She did have a ring on..." Red would pant out gently while she rubbed her wet thighs together. "P-probably works like Glasses... she can't.. cum for a.... reason made on the.. ring!" She'd say, yes, the goblins had.. magic restricting cock rings too! Still Purple nodded.. and moved to grab at Red's thighs.
"So~? That just means that cock is ours to play with.." She'd say before Red went along with it anyways.. and they started to pull that butt up and start [b]dropping[/b] her back down into that laps over and over again!

Purple would smile while she got on her feet. "Ohh but you can't cum~! I bet you're gonna lose your mind too!" She'd taunt.. it was easy to taunt someone... when it wasn't you being fucked. 
Meanwhile Red herself at first was pleasantly surprised, even about to tease her while she called them bitches. "Goblins! We'juuss--Hh-nnnG!" She'd say as her breath caught into her throat. Her voice a thick series of grunted moans as her eyes semi lolled up into her head. Her thighs tightly pressed together, her ass just quaking in a ripple emanating from every slap of Mary's hips and her thighs shaking from each collision with those unfulfilled nuts.. all while her ass just felt like it was trying to [b]pull[/b] that cock back into her ass.. making it just drag on those milking walls without any signs of stopping to try to milk that cock of it's nut.

28-08-2020 06:28:05.7 [ROOM] Praris: [i]Praris soltó una fuerte bofetada a Jinx después de recibir aquel goterón en su cabeza. La mejilla de su amada se enrojeció al instante.

28-08-2020 06:35:12.9 [ROOM] Heani: /me se tira en una mesa asegurandose que le da el aire acondicionado directamente.
28-08-2020 06:36:25.9 [ROOM] Praris: [color=cyan]"Roy! Oye Roy! Estas por aquí?"[/color]  [i]Praris sacó de entre sus pechos, sin revelarlos, un mando a distancia el cual pulsó varias veces, haciendo que una enorme descarga electrica recorriera el cuerpo del chico desde su cuello y extendiendose por todo su cuerpo, haciendo que su cabeza humeara un poco[/i]
28-08-2020 06:36:27.4 [ROOM] Soro Inari: /me Fuerza una sonrisa nerviosa, quiere lanzarse le encima y destrozarla, pero por falta de información y ya lo lo que ha visto que es capaz, la seguridad, la agresividad, y sobretodo... Su maldita forma de hablar, no parecía estar simplemente dándose en la gran cosa, así que ocultó su sed de sangre lo mejor que pudo, respirando profundo y volviendo a ver a la chica con sus ojos tan dorados como el licor que está tomaba. "Yo tampoco soy mercancía... Soy estrella de este lugar. Lo cual déjame decirte, si tú lo eras, eso fue en el pasado, ahora tú eres la mercancía, deberías tener cuidado como le hablas a la gente aquí, a excepción de Jinx... Ya eso es algo común." Moviendo sus colas, aunque hablo con seguridad, algo le inquietaba, así que por lo pronto decidió mantener al menos unos 4 pasos de distancia. 
28-08-2020 06:38:12.1 [ROOM] Mystical Fagfox: /me miro extrañada a Soro. [color=pink]"Estrella de este lugar?"[/color] No puede evitar reirse
28-08-2020 06:38:45.0 [ROOM] Roy Church: /me se encontraba durmiendo en uno de los sofás y abrió un poco los ojos aún adormilado. Sin ebargo, súbitamente un intenso dolor lo desportó tirándolo al suelo entre convulsiones "AAAAAAAAAGGGGHHH!!!!" Cuando la descarga cesó, su cabello humeaba y, reincorporándose un poco como un perrito, observó aquella silueta familiar "A... Ama Praris... ¿E... Eres tú?" preguntó bastante perplejo
28-08-2020 06:39:13.3 [ROOM] Heani: Y si eres una estrella por qué no brillas?
28-08-2020 06:39:56.5 [ROOM] Heani: /me sigue tirada intentando refrescarse con el aire.

28-08-2020 06:45:17.9 [ROOM] Praris: [i]La chica arqueaba su ceja derecha mientras escuchaba las palabras de aquella zorra vanidosa. Praris liberó sus pechos y el vestido cayó por su propio peso al suelo, la muchacha se encontraba completamente desnuda a excepción de sus tacones, su gran busto saltaba levemente con cada taconazo de avance que daba hacia aquella pareja de chicas con colas. La chica observó a ambas con detenimiento y se paró tras Soro, pasando sus brazos por encima de los hombros de la zorra y abrazandola, apretando con fuerza sus pechos contra su espalda, dejando así que notará sus pezones en su piel a través de su ropaje[/i] [color=cyan]"Estrella? Eso quiere decir que eres lo mejorcito del lugar querida? Eso tendré que decidirlo yo..."[/color]  [i]Praris elevó su mano derecha hasta juguetear con la punta de la oreja derecha de la zorra[/i]

She'd say calmly.. before pushing her hips nice and firmly so sink her cock into her in one long sloooow push of her hips to slowly hilt her on her cock until her hips pushed against Puppys~
28-08-2020 12:22:06.4 [ROOM] Puppy Ice: /me starts to giggle, "What, less than a we... mmmm," she moans long and low half way through the sentence as her sex is slowly stuffed with an increasing amount of cock. The moan turns into a deeper groan when Mella's thick tip pushes into her womb, followed by the last few inches of that shaft stretching her cunny good and wide. Eventually she finishes her statement while panting heavily now, "...eek."
28-08-2020 12:30:28.6 [ROOM] Mella Volfire: /me shuddered a bit once she got herself wedged back into Puppy's insides. "Well still a few days~" She'd laugh gently at Puppy's words, who'd seemed to barely finish her sentence by the time she bottomed out in her pussy. "Gotta keep ya reminded on the feeling I'd say~" She'd tease before her hands moved up to grab Puppy's wrists and hold them over her head.. jsut to hold a part of her before her hips pulled back.. moving over half way from her before her hips jerked forward.. and her hips slapped against Puppy's as Mella then pulled back.. and started to hump the woman on the couch~

28-08-2020 12:35:32.4 [ROOM] Puppy Ice: /me 's blue eyes widened a little as her wrists ended up pinned against the couch armrest behind her head, making her bite her lower lip slightly for a second. Her sex clung to that cock tightly yet wetly, but the hard quick thrust back in made her cry out and forget about the lip biting. She hooked one foot up onto the back of the couch and hooked the other leg around Mella's leg, without interfering with the rough deep humping that was starting to make her moan consistently and loudly at first.

28-08-2020 12:41:24.9 [ROOM] Mella Volfire: /me once she seen Puppy's moving her legs she'd slow.. but it was only about as long as maybe one thrust before they woman under her was situated.. after that brief pause Mella would tighten her grip on Puppy's wrists and pin her harder into the cushions as he weight press into her.. after feeling fully ready.. she'd start to slam into her, and with a nice hard rough jerking pace of her hips too~ Her cock making wet [sub]schlick--pap[/sub] sounds from the grinding of a wet pussy and the fleshy smacks of both, Malla's hips hitting Puppy's and her balls slapping against her butt as the blonde repeatedly battered her lovely wet insides to stretch and mold around her cock time and time again~

28-08-2020 12:47:17.9 [ROOM] Puppy Ice: /me gave a small happy whimper moan as her arms were pinned harder, followed by an even louder than before cry as her cunt was slammed roughly into yet again. In fact, those thrusts would be hard enough to shove her wide hips down into the couch cushions, which would in turn spring and push her hips back to meet the next thrust with a nice lewd wet smack as her pussy was soon damp enough to soak both their crotches. And so it continued, her moaning out and panting heavily as Mella pounded her cunt hard and fast, her body pinned but bouncing back and forth between Mella's body and the sofa. All the while her sex grew increasingly wet and slippery to increase the ease and speed Mella could pound her, while at the same time increasing the constant wet impact sounds.
28-08-2020 12:51:05.1 [ROOM] Mella Volfire: /me only kept speeding up now that she didn't have to slow this time, not like she had to earlier anyways! She'd feel her heart thumping eagerly in her bosom as her excitement was rapidly raising. Her mouth slightly parted while she lid her eyes and looked back into Puppy's gaze anytime it looked back upon herself. The pleasure of her cock grinding pussy was making her shiver. Her cock throbbing eagerly as she started to rut her pussy. loud hard SLAPS echoing on that couch maybe even creaking from the springs under it groaning under their weight each time Mella hammered into her~ Making sure eac SLAP was thick hot guttural slaps as Mella bit her own bottom lip just to briefly drag over her lip with her teeth as she felt her toes clenching briefly after every other thrust. "Mh.. shit.. I'm going to.. cum.. babe~" She'd coo as she felt like it was soon and yet.. she couldn't wait to empty her nut into her womb~
28-08-2020 12:52:37.8 [ROOM] Karurosu: Hola
28-08-2020 12:53:39.5 [ROOM] Kyleamus: Hey! Anyone home?
28-08-2020 12:57:14.2 [ROOM] Puppy Ice: /me wasn't that far behind from Mella as the speed and force of those slamming hips plowing that foot of cock into her cunt hit her spot nicely. Her moans and very breaths increased in speed and frequency thanks to the jackhammering her sex was getting, leading to her struggling to whisper out up at Mella, "That's... it... give... me every... drop... and... more!" She flexed her stomach to shove her fuckhole back to meet Mella's crotch harder to encourage even more speed and force, her cunny starting to clench harder as her climax was right around the corner and she intended to keep every sperm of Mella's cum inside her. Not to mention to help increase the friction from her pussy that all her natural lube countered.
28-08-2020 13:01:17.5 [ROOM] LunarFox: rawrf
28-08-2020 13:02:19.3 [ROOM] Mella Volfire: /me let her eyes look forward while she just let the dull and [b]wet[/b] sounds of her dick slickly bashing into that pussy ring in her ears. The lovely sounds just making her shudder under her breath. Her cock was just burning with pleasure, the urge of her climax rapidly reaching it's peak as the pressure welled and a tightness grew in her loins from her balls to the head of her cock. "Fuck.. I'm... cumm--innngg~" She'd groan out near the end in  drawn out huff as she just jammed her hips harder into Puppy's. Her breaths short and hot as she ground her hips up and down. Stirring up those wet insides in jerking motions. Her stomach taut and firm against Puppy's while her cum started to [b]pump[/b] her cum hard and deep into her lovely cum eager slit. Her cock throbbing quick and hard as her dick spurt fat hot spurts of cum deep into her pussy. Dumping her nut into hr womb over and over again in her already well stretched out pussy~ Almost trying to see if her lovely slit could handle every drop or if she'd end up drooling that cum out and around Mella's cock~

28-08-2020 13:13:18.6 [ROOM] Puppy Ice: /me felt her own body clenching up further as her fingers clamped onto each other since Mella had her wrists pinned together to the couch. Still, she felt Mella's body losing control and tried to hold off her peak so they could cum together at least. It wasn't like either of them were going to be able to stop anyways. She bit her lower lip one more time as she muffled her moans in her throat right before the climax came. The moment Mella's cock pulsed thicker inside her she moved her legs around Mella's hips and held them tightly together, any further thrusts still able to happen by Mella's hips thrusting only instead of full body movements. At the same time she let her orgasm peak and fall over the edge, her held back moaning cry released in a few short bursts as she felt the first heaviest blasts of cum exploding straight into her womb. Her cunt clenched and squeezed and milked Mella's shaft except for the top few inches in her womb as she came around that thick shaft, adding a surge of wetness to their already soaked crotches as her femcum gushed around Mella's dick. The clenching was more than tight enough to keep any cum from escaping of course, especially with her cervix clamped down a little below that bulbous cock tip. All the while her belly started to bloat upwards as all that cum kept getting pumped into her even after the first few main loads, making her pant and moan louder with each load as her belly stretched and the pressure increased. She didn't let go or stop milking Mella's cock either, wanting so much cum she'd explode practically. Not literally.

28-08-2020 13:25:41.9 [ROOM] Mella Volfire: /me held there only a few more moments while she caught her breath. Her cock no doubt swelled that woman out while she smiled and moved to run her hands through Puppy's hair before she slowly pulled her hips back.. wedging her cock out until her cock came out with a lovely wet [sub]pop[/sub] before she just rubbed that stretched out stomach as she chuckled a bit. "Mh~ Feel better? I do."

Despite everything that had just happened she still blushed a bit, clenching her cunt hard to try and keep that cum inside until she knew Mella's answer.

Smirking as her as she moved playfully keep her cock lined up with Puppy's soaking slit while she closed her left eye. "Really.. you'd want me to do that all over again to you?" She'd tease.. even pushing the head right back in with a little [sub]squish[/sub] which also made the blonde admittedly shiver.. teasing like the was shared both ways.

28-08-2020 13:41:15.1 [ROOM] Puppy Ice: /me bit her lower lip as her clenched cunny was teased with the head of that still hard cock, struggling a bit to keep all that heavy load of cream from gushing out of her so very full womb. It was taking a lot of effort so she just nodded while still blushing. She ended up biting her lower lip with a little whimper moan as Mella started pushing all that cock back inwards, forcing her to relax some so Mella could actually fit that thick tip back inside her again. She had to stay tight though, so she was actually tighter than before as she was panting heavily the whole time.

28-08-2020 13:50:51.7 [ROOM] Mella Volfire: /me decided she wanted to change it slightly if Puppy was really urging her into another fuck.. and moved to grab Puppy's knees and push them nice and back. Splaying her out with her pussy unabashedly presented towards her. "Someone miss me~?" Mella'd tease.. it was easier to do this before you started back up! Once in her she'd grind her.. stirring up her tight pussy while biting her lip.. seeing no reason to be gentle since they just fucked.. she'd rear back.. and start [sub][b]POUNDING[/b][/sub] her.. loud hard,, tit, and now belly, jiggling SLAPS. Shuddering as she made Puppy feel the force of every buck of her hips cram hard into her pussy as she started to fuck her clinging tight depths in loud wet SCHLICKS~

28-08-2020 13:58:26.7 [ROOM] Puppy Ice: /me was rather weighed down by her already heavily bloated belly and weak from her previous orgasm, so it took little effort to spread her knees wide apart and slightly upwards. In return she reached down to hold onto her legs, even if she couldn't bring them all the way up to the sides of her breasts thanks to the size of her belly. Either way it helped angle her already abused sex for Mella's cock to go a second round. And despite this being the second round, she still cried out as Mella just slammed all that cock right past her clenched cunt and punched right back into her already very full womb, "OH FUCK!" Yes. That's right, she just cussed from that. She whimper moaned at the stirring, forcing her sex to relax again and let Mella's cock be the plug instead of her clenching. The quick pull back and resumed forceful hammering into her already drenched sex made her breasts and belly start jiggling hugely from every impact, causing her to start moaning loudly and lewdly all over again.

"Mh~ Lucky you can't get pregnant, or this would do the trick~" She'd tease between two hot breaths as she reared back, her dick was nearly pulling out, just the head parting her pussy before it just instantly hilt inside of her cock clinging insides.

When Mella pulled out so far some of the cum started to pour back through her cunt, only to get plowed right back into her womb by the sudden hard thrust. Small amounts of it did escape though, gushing out around Mella's thick shaft to squirt out onto the couch. Oh there was going to be such a massive mess on the sofa by time they finished. Meanwhile her moans didn't stop, loud and sharp as she took every hit gladly and just held onto her legs as Mella fucked her a second time in a row.

[color=cyan][b]Now to the fun part, will this spell be a damage/heal spell? Or a buff/debuff one?
If you want a damage/heal spell, choose your dice roll and how many [/b][/color](1d2 costs 3 mana, 1d4 costs 5 mana, 1d6 costs 7 mana, 1d8 costs 9 mana and so on. Note: Numbers get rounded at the end, also healing spells have a base cost of 2 mana)
[color=yellow][b]Example: !damage 2d6 (mana cost 14), !heal 3d8 (mana cost 30)[/b][/color]
[color=cyan][b]But if you want a buff/debuff, choose what stat do you want to modify! [/b][/color](you can modify more than 1, each modification costs 4 mana)[color=cyan][b] and how many turns should the buff/debuff last [/b][/color](default duration is 5 turns and 5 more turns duplicate the mana cost. If you cast another buff/debuff on the same target, the first buff/debuff goes away)

28-08-2020 14:46:47.0 [ROOM] Fandom Castle Quest: Hello there! I'm looking for an extremely unique version of a snuff / abuse-focused plot, and I hope one or more of you will contact me. Here are the details:

There is a castle, which my character would be seeking to climb to the top of, to reach a McGuffin at the top. Each room would contain one or more characters under the age of 8, which you would play, who are the 'enemies' that have to be 'defeated' to spawn a key to move on to the next room. When these 'enemies' 'die', rather than any sort of realistic, graphic, bloody death, they just erupt in poofs of smoke, like defeated Mario bosses! This RP is not intended to be particularly realistic, and the physics and logic in this place are inspired by, and true to video games. There is no blood, no realistic wounds, enemies can blink red when damaged, and are often damaged using specific 'gimmicks' that feel like they belong in a video game - a shy, emotionally fragile character, for example, may have a setup where my character has to insult them to lower an invulnerability barrier so they can be attacked and damaged, or a being of shadow may have to be damaged utilizing various light sources. Glowing weak spots, healthbars, power meters, and other video game tropes are right at home here, in this unique and special abuse-themed RP. Nothing gets me going like shoving a little brat on their ass, and getting a nice, satisfying squeal of, "OWWIE!"or, "MOMMY!" or, "WAHHHH!", then rushing in, leaping into the air, and coming down with a Mario-style stomp on their head, to deal more damage, getting bounced into the air, and being able to come down on them multiple times, to hurt them more and more! I know this odd, more 'cutesy' take on abuse isn't for everyone, but it's super fun, and I really hope we can get something rolling! I would love to give some little brats some owwies, booboos, and making them scream for their mommy!

28-08-2020 14:57:45.8 [ROOM] Puppy Ice: /me clung to her legs as her bust bounced and jiggled back and forth between her muzzle and her bulging belly, trapped to either side by her upper arms as her nipples stuck up into the air with her arousal. There wasn't anything she could do about her big breasts wobbling, she could barely hold onto her legs as Mella continued hammering her cunt with impressive stamina. Even more impressive considering it was a second time. At the same time she started feeling her second orgasm started to build with the force of the fucking she was getting, causing her panting moans to grow slightly more frequent and louder. It was of course harder to clench with a foot of thick cock plowing her already cum filled cunt, but she did it anyways to encourage both their pleasure to increase. Her womb was already bloated hugely upwards she couldn't wait for a second load to make it even 'worse'.

Mella had one more thing to do.. pulling her hands from Puppy's shoulders.. to start pinching her erect nipples. Rubbing them and even gently pushing down on then between her rougher pinching to tease her lovely nubs while her cock sloppily pounded her pussy.. it felt like their hips were sticky with their own arousal, Mella's nuts connected to Puppy's pucker with strings of cum that repeatedly was bashed against her lovely folds before her hips just PUSHED against her hips . "Fuck.. Cum... ming again.." She'd say as she then pulled back.. slow thrust, once a second as each one [sub]PAP..PAP..PAP[/sub]  Fucking the cum into her dick literally with each pump of her hips while Mella was practically starting to glisten with a thin sheen of sweat, and flushed breasts while atop Puppy~

28-08-2020 15:15:00.4 [ROOM] Puppy Ice: /me was already getting close to an orgasm again, and she was already trying to clamp tightly around Mella's cock, so the pinching and twisting and tugging of her fat teats gave her an extra push. The pinching was strong and painful enough to make her pussy clamp down harder, which also pushed her over the edge as her rapid moans reached a peak and she cried out loudly while her body started shuddering along with the jiggling already being caused from the pounding she was getting. This time she didn't try to speak as Mella built up to a second climax as well. With her arms wrapped around her legs she couldn't hook them around Mella's hips, but she didn't really care as that cock slowed down to release a second cum load into her already cum filled womb. It took most of her effort just to keep her cunt as tight as she possibly could around Mella's shaft as even more pressure built up inside her innermost chamber, more pints of cream being pumped into her and causing her belly to look like a beach ball practically. It would be subtle at first, but her breasts would start growing a little larger as Mella kept unloading into her with those super productive balls. About all she could do was cling to her legs and give off constant whining, panting, lewd moans as she felt so incredibly full. Her orgasm finished but feeling so stretched was kind of an orgasmic feeling all in it's own, her mouth open and nearly drooling down onto her increased cleavage.

28-08-2020 15:29:46.6 [ROOM] Puppy Ice: /me kept panting high pitched nonstop as she could barely move, but when Mella started to pull out she struggled to reach for her thong... only to have Mella beat her to it. The high pressure flood of cum, easily more than a gallon worth, all tried to escape at once without that cock plugging her womb. With the thong in place it blocked the flow, keeping all that pressure and tension on her belly nice and trapped. That also meant she constantly felt like she'd explode, like a massive orgasm that just wouldn't go over the edge. She panted and moaned and whined and nodded to Mella. There was going to be little else she could do until her body shifted some of the pressure or it was released.

[color=cyan][b]Now to the fun part, will this spell be a damage/heal spell? Or a buff/debuff one?
If you want a damage/heal spell, choose your dice roll and how many [/b][/color](1d2 costs 3 mana, 1d4 costs 5 mana, 1d6 costs 7 mana, 1d8 costs 9 mana and so on. Note: Numbers get rounded at the end, also healing spells have a base cost of 2 mana)

[color=cyan][b]But if you want a buff/debuff, choose what stat do you want to modify! [/b][/color](you can modify more than 1, each modification costs 4 mana)[color=cyan][b] and how many turns should the buff/debuff last [/b][/color](default duration is 5 turns and 5 more turns duplicate the mana cost.

[color=green][b]Mana cost: 0[/b][/color] (Note: you start with 10 mana on your first turn, you get 10 mana if you cast a spell and 20 if you pass your turn. You get extra mana depending on the round count)

[color=cyan][b]Now to the fun part, will this spell be a damage/heal spell? Or a buff/debuff one?
If you want a damage/heal spell, choose your dice roll and how many [/b][/color](1d2 costs 3 mana, 1d4 costs 5 mana, 1d6 costs 7 mana, 1d8 costs 9 mana and so on. Note: Numbers get rounded at the end, also healing spells have a base cost of 2 mana)
[color=yellow][b]Example: !damage 2d6 (mana cost 14), !heal 3d8 (mana cost 30)[/b][/color]
[color=cyan][b]But if you want a buff/debuff, choose what stat do you want to modify! [/b][/color](you can modify more than 1, each modification costs 4 mana)[color=cyan][b] and how many turns should the buff/debuff last [/b][/color](default duration is 5 turns and 5 more turns duplicate the mana cost. If you cast another buff/debuff on the same target, the first buff/debuff goes away)
[color=yellow][b]Example: !debuff 3 to int (Mana cost 12), !buff 1 to agi and 1 to int (Mana cost 8), !buff 2 to agi for 10 turns (Mana cost 16)
[/b][/color][color=cyan][b]You can also buff/debuff your or your opponent's defense, decreasing/increasing the LP taken by any spell[/b][/color] (Each point costs 10 mana)
[color=yellow][b]Example: !debuff 2 to defense (Mana cost 20)

That sway, her hair floating a bit behind her as she felt the heat pass her chin, a few bits of the cob web like fabric of her outfit only getting singed.   "Nice...   I have to commend that!"   Her ears perked up as she grew more excited.

She then grins and the wind gives her magical punches that when landing, they leave a lot of magical lust on the impact zone~ She goes for a quick tit combo then a hook to Vane's face and finishes with a sudden uppercut to her pussy~!

They were appropriately in a boxing ring for this special match. As the bell rings, I move in cautiously looking at my opponent to see if there was an opening I could see. My chest starts to bounce slightly delayed with the rest of my body. Within striking range, I move into a proper stance. 
28-08-2020 16:12:18.9 [ROOM] Mella Volfire: /me laughed as she moved to wrap her towel back over her tit. "Sorry, but money here is a slow going thing when you give it to people.. that's twenty bucks a day at best.. and that's assuming you don't get pregnant in the mean time~" Winking at her as she moved to playfully slap Macawi's crotch~

The ropes at least gave her something to hold onto as the fiery haired bunny felt that harsh shot to her chest, her face only barely feeling the graze and sure that some of the fabric covering her mound was ripped away from that shot.   The wind did nothing to help as she panted hotly, eyes flickering.   "I.... Got to take notes..."  She hissed out lustfully before finally freeing herself from the embrace of the wind.   Instead, it was her turn to see if she could do the same.   The sleek bunny stepped forward, her arms leaving behind a playful mirror of her limbs, a mix of water and air, as she tried to wrap herself around Emily, to both clinch the white haired robo bunny and to also let the phantom limbs batter at and caress over her.

28-08-2020 16:14:25.4 [ROOM] Macawi Cox: /me is still pouting towards the woman, then feels the slap to her crotch, jumping a little bit at the same time and looking back towards her. "Hmph... I thought you had more money than that, with how often you get to fight... and the fact you were here longer." She has to push her skirt down, then sees someone else approaching Mella. "Seems you'll be busy, so I can try a match with someone else, now." Or at least she thinks that. "Who's up for a match!!!"
28-08-2020 16:15:30.1 [ROOM] Mella Volfire: /me blinks and rubs her ass before smiling at Setsuka. "Hey pup~ How're ya?" She'd say before.. sneaking a hard smack on Macawi's ass. "And that's for taunting me hun. I got plenty of money."
28-08-2020 16:15:39.7 [ROOM] Mella Volfire: !spank to Macawi Cox

28-08-2020 16:15:50.6 [ROOM] Arcade Bunny Vanessa: /me was light in her step as she let her eyes dance over Sierra so.   The light caught the shine of the aphrodisiac on her black and purple gloves.  It was wonderful as she took a deep breath, pushing her chest out to tease but then her stance moved into something far more proper, those gloves locked up over her core.
28-08-2020 16:15:55.9 [ROOM] Puppy Ice: /me 's pretty sure that was an orgasmic spank.

28-08-2020 16:17:41.6 [ROOM] Macawi Cox: /me jumps to the sudden swat to her backside, rubbing her sore muscles with that pouting face, once more. Since it seems no one's up for a match against her, she simply moves over and sits down on a chair, deciding to watch things, for now.
28-08-2020 16:18:19.1 [ROOM] Sierra Carran: /me decided to try to take the first shot. Throwing out a few quick jabs to try and establish the distance between them. With the aphrodisiac applied to the gloves, I figure I did not really need to hit her with much power. The Aphrodisiac would do the work that my punches were normally meant to do. I was probably a little too far away from her, but I wanted to keep the distance between us. 
28-08-2020 16:18:29.8 [ROOM] Boxing Emily Bot: /me tastes her lips as she enjoys watching Vane's body getting magically pummeled around~ and then she gets back on guard, looking at the rival bunny girl "Come at me~" she taunts a bit and as Vane comes for that sudden clinch, she sidesteps to barely dodge that magical embrace and grins "Miss again~" she sticks her tongue out and surrounds her glove with air, sending a quick jab combo to Vane's belly~ the magic lingering on her body and coming down some to stimulate her pussy from the inside~

I did a quick grocery trip and bugged some goof balls on here.. and now I see two more goof balls." She'd say as she thumbed to Macawi's butt.. then leaned in and smooched Setsuka on the lips. "Course I'm always glad to see my pup though~"
28-08-2020 16:20:00.6 [ROOM] Setsuka Hishiki: /me wags her tail as she was smooched. She yelps a little before giggling up against the gorgeous blonde gently. Her fingers caress that beautiful face while she listens to her talk about her day.
28-08-2020 16:21:44.2 [ROOM] Arcade Bunny Vanessa: /me whimpered as she was shown that the usually good boxing bunny was out of her depth in this.   The sidestep made her actually try to give chance but then the jab combo found her body, her stomach taking the shots but the sensation was actually what got to the redhead.   Panting, she felt her knee give a tiny bit.  "Oooh you..."  She growled hotly as she twisted quick and she tried to get at least some chance to feel Emily's body against her fingers, a fast pair of little straights aimed for the silver haired bunny's frame.

28-08-2020 16:37:41.0 [ROOM] Arcade Bunny Vanessa: /me nodded so much.  It had been so long since she had been in this position, learning but as those jabs found her tits, more clothes torn and she spilled out.  Make up ruined, she was not quite as elegant in how she took the wind but more now just letting herself melt and enjoy the attention.   Her quivering form betrayed how good it was feeling.   "I hate...  to say yes but oh my yes!"  She groaned out so very lustfully but her pride would not let her just lay down and take it.   Again, she tried to step with the two, her gloves were quick as they snapped out to find Emily's sides, to batter her about but also aiming to let them trace up, hoping to drag and tear at the laces holding her outfit tight.

With a big smirk she hooks her legs in the ropes to keep the blonde propped up before hooking her own legs into the middle ropes and her ankles along the bottom ones. “Here we go baby..” she mashed that fat ass down along her pale sensitive cock with those dark cheeks.

[color=cyan][b]Now to the fun part, will this spell be a damage/heal spell? Or a buff/debuff one?
If you want a damage/heal spell, choose your dice roll and how many [/b][/color](1d2 costs 3 mana, 1d4 costs 5 mana, 1d6 costs 7 mana, 1d8 costs 9 mana and so on. Note: Numbers get rounded at the end, also healing spells have a base cost of 2 mana)
[color=yellow][b]Example: !damage 2d6 (mana cost 14), !heal 3d8 (mana cost 30)[/b][/color]
[color=cyan][b]But if you want a buff/debuff, choose what stat do you want to modify! [/b][/color](you can modify more than 1, each modification costs 4 mana)[color=cyan][b] and how many turns should the buff/debuff last [/b][/color](default duration is 5 turns and 5 more turns duplicate the mana cost. If you cast another buff/debuff on the same target, the first buff/debuff goes away)
[color=yellow][b]Example: !debuff 3 to int (Mana cost 12), !buff 1 to agi and 1 to int (Mana cost 8), !buff 2 to agi for 10 turns (Mana cost 16)
[/b][/color][color=cyan][b]You can also buff/debuff your or your opponent's defense, decreasing/increasing the LP taken by any spell[/b][/color] (Each point costs 10 mana)

28-08-2020 17:20:17.5 [ROOM] Boxing Emily Bot: Buffed healing spells (thought the update won't update for the current match, only once you finish)
28-08-2020 17:22:08.0 [ROOM] Sierra Carran: !me starts to try to gain a favorable position in the ring, this first hit seemed not to do too much. It was a scratch, at most. There was a lingering effect, and I was not entirely interested in trying to find out what would happen if those gloves of hers ended up hitting me or rubbing against me in some way. As I try to circle around, I find that she matches me move for move. I am not quite at the ropes, but my opponent was doing a good job of cutting the ring off for me to improve my position either. I was going to have to concede the control of the ring over to her for the time being. 
28-08-2020 17:23:40.3 [ROOM] Mella Volfire: /me narrowed her eyes as Setsuka set them both up on the ropes like that.. Setsuka practically primed herself from an ass fucking and yet Mella had already cum... this was her third time after Puppy and she had to admit she was panting already while she lid her eyes. "Oh.. am I gonna need another shower." she'd grumble before smiling at Setsuka in spite of it all.. long ass winning streak or not, she couldn't help but be proud of Setsuka for beating her.. even as her cock twitched in a [b]throb[/b] as her ass sunk onto that dick and made her thighs shake.
28-08-2020 17:25:37.9 [ROOM] Setsuka Hishiki: /me leaning back into Mella, she feels those hot tits on her back as she began roughly riding her fat cock aggressively. “Fuck babe.. I’m going to make sure your balls are nice and empty by the time I’m done.. that’s my prize~” She tilts her own head back, grabbing the blonde’s beautiful head of hair and licking over her cheek long and possessively.
28-08-2020 17:27:06.5 [ROOM] Sierra Carran: !endmatch
28-08-2020 17:27:41.1 [ROOM] Arcade Bunny Vanessa: There is happiness on my face, conceding me the ring, I know I have gotten the chance to keep you from being able to dance like I can.   My gloves stay over my face, careful to not accidentally smear myself with the drugs that we both are too aware are on them.   A quick step happens, my right leading as I try to snap a fast cross, hoping to pull those gloves up but it is all a subtle feint, hoping my best to get my left in, hoping to sink that leather in above that little number you are wearing.

28-08-2020 17:30:54.4 [ROOM] Mella Volfire: /me shuddered as her ass kept slamming into her dick. She wanted to grab her hips and fuck her back but it was easier to hold herself up right now. Her elbows on the middle rope while holding the top ones in her hands. Panting as she lid her eyes and leaned in to lightly bite the back of Setsuka's neck while she huffed out a hot breath. "Tch... you... dirty.. pup~"
28-08-2020 17:33:12.9 [ROOM] Setsuka Hishiki: /me yanks her lips into her own. “Mmm..” She rolls her tongue around in that mouth aggressively, letting Mella feel the harsh smack of her cheeks clapping into her lap repeatedly. The way her heavy tits bounce while spatted in Mella’s cum only seemed to make them shine in the spotlights. “I’m your pup.. and you’re my human... now fuck me like you mean it..”
28-08-2020 17:33:15.0 [ROOM] Sierra Carran: /me tried to find a way to improve my position in the ring. Trying a few head fakes, but nothing worked. I saw her go for another attack, and instinctively I raise my hands to defend myself. Careful to try to not allow my own gloves to touch my body, I deflect the first attack but am far too late to respond to the next attack that hits my belly again. The sting of the punch was minor, but the aphrodisiac again came into contact with my body. This time a more solid attack which left my belly tingling. I let out a soft gasp which ended up being partly a moan as well, as I bent slightly forward from the impact.

28-08-2020 17:38:08.2 [ROOM] Arcade Bunny Vanessa: "Careful..."  The seductive taunt was right there on my painted lips as I see you slip forward slightly.  It isn't much but it all I can think about, that slight opening.   The way that my body just shivers at the idea as that moan hangs in my ears.   I know what I want, what I desire.   One more step, closing the distance, to again herd you, to force your eyes to only see me and mine, hoping to mask what is about to come.   That low duck, my right pulling back as I try to set up for my hope of driving it up, to split that bare chest, to smear the insides with the wonderful little drug and to find your chin.
28-08-2020 17:41:35.3 [ROOM] Mella Volfire: /me narrowed her eyes.. as she let out a hot breath after rolling her tongue along Setsuka's.. shivering before going to reach out and grab her hips lightly. "Fine.." She'd huff as she moved to smirk and lean into her to whisper something into her ears as she unhook her own legs from that rope so she could stand up in her corner.
Then after saying her words she'd push Setuska from behind.. trying to force her to bend over and let her Setsuka catch herself with her hands.. or not and then just [b]yanked[/b] her into her thrusts.. With Setsuka's legs on the ropes she was practically just slam bouncing her onto her over fucked cock!
28-08-2020 17:45:04.9 [ROOM] Setsuka Hishiki: /me leans forwards and reaches back to hold Mella’s forearms in an impressive show of strength. She helps mash her fat ass back into her repeatedly, making the ropes shake from how she gripped them with her legs and slammed back on each inch of Mella’s cock. “Mnnnh that’s right.. get this ass baby.. fuck me till your hips and balls ache..”
28-08-2020 17:46:26.7 [ROOM] Sierra Carran: /me tried to defend myself as best I could. I look at her body, but her gaze was so dominant that I look her in the eyes for a brief moment. As I do so, I was already behind what was happening. I try to reach out in an effort to possibly clinch her. My attempt fails, as she ducks down. I feel a punch graze my chest, splitting through my breasts as they wobbled around from the impact. The aphrodisiac applying itself from even the slightest touch, caused my chest to tingle. The feeling somewhat paralyzing me as she finishes her punch. An uppercut that lands squarely on my chin. The impact of which causes me to fall down to the mat onto my backside. My back was supported by the ropes as I fall down to the mat in a seated position. 
28-08-2020 17:49:16.1 [ROOM] Arcade Bunny Vanessa: My eyes look down at you leaning in that corner as a smile slips across my cheek.   My foot slips forward between those legs, not touching anything but tapping the canvas.   "I didn't even buy you dinner and you are down..."  I taunt playfully as I take such an eager, deep breath.  I don't need the drug to feel the excitement race through me, warming me up.   There is a loud tap as I start the count up, desire hanging on my lips.   "One..."

She was already on the edge earlier but she did shudder as her hips pushed nice and hard up "Fuck.."  She'd say as her nuts started to tense up tightly.. wedging her admittedly shorter load into Setsuka's ass over and over while she was panting ever so hotly over and over again.

Another moan, soft on my lips as I can feel that warmth growing in me.  Finally, my intent made clear as I throw a harsh straight, my right seeking to see if I can split your guard, to make you taste the leather of my glove in this.

28-08-2020 18:23:58.7 [ROOM] Sierra Carran: /me moves off the ropes after getting up, only a step or two as my opponent seemed eager to try to capitalize on the knockdown. I was not beaten down yet, not by a long shot. I had the basic idea that I would try to counter attack whatever my opponent did. If only to keep her off me for a few moments. She did not seem to want to try to set this punch up, and I could clearly see the attack. The punch absorbed itself into my gloves however I had to also use my arms to block which spreads more of the aphrodesiac lotion onto my body. Even with the tingling, I try to make my move and throw a pair of punches aimed at the chest of my opponent. I start with a quick left followed by a right of my own. Each aimed at a single breast so that I could possibly get both if these punches land.

[color=cyan][b]Now to the fun part, will this spell be a damage/heal spell? Or a buff/debuff one?
If you want a damage/heal spell, choose your dice roll and how many [/b][/color](1d2 costs 3 mana, 1d4 costs 5 mana, 1d6 costs 7 mana, 1d8 costs 9 mana and so on. Note: Numbers get rounded at the end, also healing spells have a base cost of 2 mana)
[color=yellow][b]Example: !damage 2d6 (mana cost 14), !heal 3d8 (mana cost 30)[/b][/color]
[color=cyan][b]But if you want a buff/debuff, choose what stat do you want to modify! [/b][/color](you can modify more than 1, each modification costs 4 mana)[color=cyan][b] and how many turns should the buff/debuff last [/b][/color](default duration is 5 turns and 5 more turns duplicate the mana cost. If you cast another buff/debuff on the same target, the first buff/debuff goes away)
[color=yellow][b]Example: !debuff 3 to int (Mana cost 12), !buff 1 to agi and 1 to int (Mana cost 8), !buff 2 to agi for 10 turns (Mana cost 16)
[/b][/color][color=cyan][b]You can also buff/debuff your or your opponent's defense, decreasing/increasing the LP taken by any spell[/b][/color] (Each point costs 10 mana)

[i]Robert grabs you up by the legs and drops you down onto your back. Keeping his grip on your legs he holds them each under his arms. Sitting back on his butt, he puts his legs around your torso. As you lay back, helplessly in his grip he brings his feet up over your face and wiggles his toes. ‘I’d hold my breath if I were you,’ he coos before he shoves those feet into your face. He clamps on to your nose and rubs his soles across your face. The sweaty fabric of his socks smothering you. He then shoves a toe inside of your mouth and all you can taste is sweat and musk. Finally, he lets you go but the scent of man sweat lingers in your nostrils.[/i]

[i]Robert takes you down to the mat and breaks out some, frankly, impressive wrestling skills you didn’t know he had. You’re lying on your stomach when he grabs your arms and pulls them up painfully behind your back. You start to roll, reflexively as he walks his legs around your body until you’re lying on your back. Taking one big step with his right leg, he stomps down on the other side of your head. Now, with both legs on either side of your head, he uses that right legs to scoop up your head, and locks his ankle behind his left knee, clamping in a figure-four. You are pinned down to the mat, your face shoved into Robert’s ass and balls. He flexes his thighs around your head and arches his back up, causing your head to be shoved even deeper into the hold. You can barely make out what he’s saying, ‘How do you like my headscissors, bitch?’ He asks, laughing sadistically. Helpless to escape, he eventually lets up and gets off of you.[/i]

[i]Robert’s cock swells to meet yours as you begin to grind against him. ‘Agh… fuck no more, please’ he whines.[/i]

28-08-2020 23:33:50.9 [PRIV] Bot to Karela:
[i]Robert swaggers over to you, a spring in his step and a mischievous grin. He licks his lips and makes a dive for your waist. He wraps his arms around you and takes you down to the mat, where he folds your legs up and over your head, with your back firmly pinned to the mat. He looks down at you from between your thighs and flashes you his pearly whites. Then he grabs the waist-band of your gear and pulls it down, letting your cock flop out. He looks back to you and whistles, ‘Not too shabby.’ He compliments you before he opens his mouth and sucks your length in in one fell swoop. Sucking and bobbing his head, Robert causes you to stifle a moan as his warm mouth works on your shaft. Satisfied, he pulls away, your cock falling out of his mouth with a *plop.* He stands up and wipes away a strand of drool from his chin, motioning for you to get back to your feet. [/i]

28-08-2020 23:34:38.9 [PRIV] Bot to Karela:
[i]Robert takes you down to the mat and breaks out some, frankly, impressive wrestling skills you didn’t know he had. You’re lying on your stomach when he grabs your arms and pulls them up painfully behind your back. You start to roll, reflexively as he walks his legs around your body until you’re lying on your back. Taking one big step with his right leg, he stomps down on the other side of your head. Now, with both legs on either side of your head, he uses that right legs to scoop up your head, and locks his ankle behind his left knee, clamping in a figure-four. You are pinned down to the mat, your face shoved into Robert’s ass and balls. He flexes his thighs around your head and arches his back up, causing your head to be shoved even deeper into the hold. You can barely make out what he’s saying, ‘How do you like my headscissors, bitch?’ He asks, laughing sadistically. Helpless to escape, he eventually lets up and gets off of you.[/i]

[color=cyan][b]Now to the fun part, will this spell be a damage/heal spell? Or a buff/debuff one?
If you want a damage/heal spell, choose your dice roll and how many [/b][/color](1d2 costs 3 mana, 1d4 costs 5 mana, 1d6 costs 7 mana, 1d8 costs 9 mana and so on. Note: Numbers get rounded at the end, also healing spells have a base cost of 2 mana)
[color=yellow][b]Example: !damage 2d6 (mana cost 14), !heal 3d8 (mana cost 30)[/b][/color]
[color=cyan][b]But if you want a buff/debuff, choose what stat do you want to modify! [/b][/color](you can modify more than 1, each modification costs 4 mana)[color=cyan][b] and how many turns should the buff/debuff last [/b][/color](default duration is 5 turns and 5 more turns duplicate the mana cost. If you cast another buff/debuff on the same target, the first buff/debuff goes away)
[color=yellow][b]Example: !debuff 3 to int (Mana cost 12), !buff 1 to agi and 1 to int (Mana cost 8), !buff 2 to agi for 10 turns (Mana cost 16)
[/b][/color][color=cyan][b]You can also buff/debuff your or your opponent's defense, decreasing/increasing the LP taken by any spell[/b][/color] (Each point costs 10 mana)
