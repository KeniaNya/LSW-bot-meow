So, you start at the town (nobody on the black list)
!routes
-A, B, C
!go A
The bot will open up the room, send the link via PM to the person, and once they enter the room, kick them from the town
Town remains open but if the player on A joins it, it gets kicked from A, meanwhile, everyone is blacklisted on A, except the player that used !go A

When a player chooses to go to a room, the /openroom stays in place until that player joins
if another player uses the !go command, they get added to the waiting list
when a player enters the room, they get removed form the waiting list, when the waiting list is empty, the room gets /closeroom

Other option is to always have the routes linked in the room
and you can only enter those routes when you're in the proper room
for example... if you are in town 1, you are white listed in A, B, C
if you are in A, you're white listed in town 1, forest and cave, etc.


Town 1
	A
		Forest
		Cave
	B
		Town 2
	C
		Coast
		Town 3
			Ferry
				Wildlands

Steps:
black list for rooms
open and close the room (maybe not) I could even set up bans o_O, or just auto-kick people
identify what user is in what room and the valid ways they can go

{player} has entered the {place name}. Valid routes: {routeList}
Specific commands for each room (have one big file but with flags... or many files, one for each room?)
