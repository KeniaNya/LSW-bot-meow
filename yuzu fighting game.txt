[u][b]Fighting Rules:[/b][/u]

Fights are 3 rounds, 10 turns each. Each player has 30 health, but can have extra HP if a Moderator wishes for a more fair fight. Your collected wins increase your attack bonus of your d12 by +1, to a maximum of 5. 

If you lose, you lose your bonus attack and your streak resets, but you keep the bonus HP. Losers can get +5 HP for losing twice. The maximum amount of HP is 60.

Every turn, both players roll 1d12. The higher roll wins, the loser takes the difference between the two rolls as damage. Sometimes, if a fighter is particularly popular, they can get up to a +5 bonus to their rolls by fans 'charging' their power with money, 10,000 per bonus point. And 10,000 per +5 HP. These are of course, only for one fight only. 

If a player rolls a natural 1, without modifiers, the other player can roll an attack die of half damage (a single d6) to add onto the difference between rolls. If you roll a natural 12, you also get a d6 bonus damage added do your attack.

You must rp the result of the rolls, but the person who lost the roll, has to post their rp second to the one who won.

At the end of every round, or 10 turns, you can roll a 1d10, plus 1/4th of your total HP to see how much health you recover. 

After 3 rounds, the highest remaining HP will be considered the winner. 

The users can bet on the fight, but only during round one. The betting is closed after that, and the winner gets 50% of what people have bets on them, the losers bets are gone.
