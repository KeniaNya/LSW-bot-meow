 so basicly you get eggs, the more eggs you gather the higher your reward at the end. 

You get an egg after a fight, fixed
You get an egg with your daily, fixed
You can get an egg with posts. Like your posts needs to be at least 20-40 words long. But that only gives you a 1% chance to get an egg. For every 10 words more your chance raises 1% though if possible i would like that only words that didnt repeat work into that. 

Finally i would like that you cant check how many eggs you have gathered already. That makes it more like, hey cool i got an egg and not like i have 30 eggs i need more. Since hardly anyone would track it over a week or so.

At the end it gives rewards depending how many you gathered.
