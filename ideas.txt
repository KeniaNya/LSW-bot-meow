no hands match


[17:34] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: If you want to be competitive, you'll get a character with a ranking who can not get money sent to and who can't have more than, say, 50 points.
[17:34] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: If you just want to have a good rump, you'll get a card with no rankings, able to send and receive money, able to create gods or whimpy losers, etc.
[17:34] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: You separate casual play from ladder.
[17:34] [user]Kenia Nya[/user]: Oh yes, my plan is just to give everyone a set amount of starting stat points and that's it, no more buying them
[17:34] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: Hmm... Know your audience, Kenia.
[17:34] [user]Kenia Nya[/user]: ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I love your idea!
[17:35] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: There's a lot of people who are into the whole levelling up thing.
[17:35] [user]Kenia Nya[/user]: damm you're a genious x.x
[17:35] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: And, of course, ladder characters can't play with casual ones.
[17:35] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: But you should have a way to 'copy' your ladder character into casual play (but not the other way around, obviously)
[17:35] [user]Kenia Nya[/user]: A
[17:35] [user]Kenia Nya[/user]: MA
[17:35] [user]Kenia Nya[/user]: ZING
[17:36] [user]Kenia Nya[/user]: O_O
[17:36] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: Pffft
[17:36] [user]Kenia Nya[/user]: [eicon]mindblown[/eicon]
[17:36] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: Now you are starting to sound disingenuous.
[17:36] [user]Kenia Nya[/user]: No, this is seriously the best idea
[17:36] [user]Kenia Nya[/user]: I've gotten
[17:36] [user]Kenia Nya[/user]: O_O
[17:36] [user]Kenia Nya[/user]: No joke
[17:36] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: You are not being sarcastic, you cheeky [s]cunt[/s]cat?
[17:36] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: Well, alright.
[17:36] [user]Kenia Nya[/user]: hey! >_<
[17:36] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: X3
[17:37] [user]Kenia Nya[/user]: Don't call me cuntcat!
[17:37] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: I didn't. I called you a cheeky [s]cunt[/s]cat!
[17:37] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: Anyway. I don't know how [b]feasible[/b] this thing is, though.
[17:37] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: I know very little about the infrastructure that would require.
[17:37] [user]Kenia Nya[/user]: super easy, barely an inconvenience
[17:38] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: Great, then!
[17:38] [user]Kenia Nya[/user]: Thanksssssssssssssssssss
[17:38] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: Also, I'm stealing that icon.
[17:38] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: [eicon]mindblown[/eicon]
[17:38] [user]Kenia Nya[/user]: this will fix stuff soooooooooooooooo much
[17:38] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: Also, if you want to make things even more legit...
[17:38] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: Competitive players should receive differentiated rewards.
[17:39] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: For example... Let's take the levels as A-B-C-D-E-F for ease of explaining.
[17:39] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: And let's pretend 2 lv. C users fight.
[17:39] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: The winner gets 100% of a reward, the loser gets, say, 50%
[17:39] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: You follow so far?
[17:39] [user]Kenia Nya[/user]: yes
[17:40] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: Now, consider those values as absolutes. 100% of 100 and 50% of 100
[17:40] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: If a C-level fights against a D-level and wins, C user gets 50% of 100 reward. D-level still gets 50% for losing.
[17:41] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: Now, if C-level user fights against an E-level user, even if he wins, he'd get 5% or 0% since the fight should be too easy then.
[17:41] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: And if C-level user loses, then 0%
[17:41] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: Like Exp. on an RPG game.
[17:42] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: now, if C-level fights a B-level and wins, I'd say C-level should get 120% for example.
[17:42] [user]Kenia Nya[/user]: love it
[17:42] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: but that should be the top. If an E-level fights an A-level and wins, still only 120%
[17:42] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: Otherwise you'd have a massive overlevel problem in your hands.
[17:44] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: That would encourage lower levels to challenge those above them, but to not go against 'boss monsters' because they'd get pummeled... And even if they win, they would get the same as if they go for someone 1 level above them.
[17:44] [user]Femboy Sexfighter[/user]: And it would also give the higher level user an incentive to fight those 1 level below them because they get a diminished reward, but for an easy fight.

Optional: Draining?

My two cents: Scrap the money, make people's equipment roleplay effective only but also free. 

Expand on the resistances and addictions to specific combinations. Using Adaria as an example, her weakness would be specifically 'Opponent's Ass to Her face.' Give people enough points to customize a fun character without giving them enough to be amazing at everything. 

Now the only way to get an advantage in a sex fight is to know what you opponent likes. 

I'd be curious about your thoughts on this even if you implement none of it. <3

Tournament! instead of a tree, you can only challenge people with the same number of wins!

Skills! Cada que subes de nivel, puedes escojer de un arbol de skills (o quisas de una lista) estos son movimientos especiales como...
triple ataque, resistencia mejorada, una parte ignora resistencia, etc...

You remember my idea about bukakke matches because it involves people in the room to make it more active. Think of this. !bukakke for anyone that wants to cum or squirt on the person in the center. The person in the center registers by !bukakke center. To cum you: !cum or !squirt. The person in the center losses pints out of 200 every time they are cum or squirt on. Hit points from people cumming can be based on thier sex stats, so some are more devistating then others. I feel something like this would add a lot to your rooms, kinda like the !bb dice adds fun. I know I have said it a few times, but since I forget, I can't remember if I ever wrote it down for you this idea. After my brain surgeries and cancer my short term memory is always bad.

A special "force" move that would grant the attacker two attacks in a row if successful, or cause a passed turn if not! 

multiple orgasm matches *****************************************

Balance bets (max 100?)
Make clothes and stripping more impactful ****************************

stat point betting

More flexibility on weaknesses
Some sort of item that can do a -3 defense on feet. Though I sort of wish there was also a method of specifiying weaknesses. Like---
A is into having their butt rubbed, but not into rubbing butts. 
B is into having paws put on their face, but not putting their paws on someone's face.

Looking for a match list!

Feats...
Special moves you can buy.

All Out...
Go full offense or full defense...

Maneuvers...
Types of attacks. Mostly I'm thinking in the grappling, get a grip on their hair or a hand around their throat or cock and they need to break out of that.

More strengths/weaknesses...
Let indulging go more than 3? Sell off stat points? Traits you can buy just like items that have varying stats to them, good or bad.

they were suggesting possibly having people who are bi but with a male preference or whatever to be able to have different addictions regarding sex. so they could still be strong against pussy attacks but weak to cock

Sending this one via note because it's a bit involved, might be a bit much to set-up and code:

Gear would need a slight revamp, have the options for a Top (cover Lips[Head?]/Breasts), Bottom (cover Sex/Ass), and Accessory (cover Fingers/Feet) on defense, and the usual Toy on offense. I'm not sure where equipment is going next update, so I'll hold off on any "rebalancing" the multiple pieces in price and stats for now.

Offensive Stripping would have one of two options:
- !stripXXXX, where XXXX is the chosen article (Top, Bottom, Accessory, Toy). Can be done once per turn, with a (Lost Lust X 2) chance of success, and if successful the player can then also do a normal attack that turn. If failed, end turn.
- !strip, under the same limits/rules as now, except take away the +10 bonus and make it flat (Lost Lust) chance of success. 

"Defensive"/Self stripping should always be an option, but I'm torn on whether to even consider a partial strip there. And a self strip should cut the next attack by half, just for the "time" needed to strip.

Just some ideas,
Amanda.

Strawweight: under 130 lbs: -2 on all defenses, always attacks first, +10% on stripping chance, +20 on default health
Lightweight: 130-175 lbs: -1 on all defenses, +5% on stripping chance, +10 on default health
Middleweight: no changes
Heavyweight: 220 - 330 lbs: +1 on all defenses, +5% on smutality chance, -10 on default health
Super heavyweight: over 330 lbs: +2 on all defenses, takes 25% instead of 50% damage if not starting first, +10% smutality chance, -20 on default health

                                        [b][color=red]Rules of the Room[/color][/b]

1: Respect the Mods and Room-owner. What they say is to be followed, whether you like it or not.
   Not following the mods or Room-owners instructions can result in a kick or time-out.
   Complaints of these instructions can be addressed to [user]Kenia Nya[/user]

2: Respect the [url=https://wiki.f-list.net/Rules]official F-List rules.[/url]

3: No hard kinks. That includes snuff, gore, vore, scat, and watersports. The focus of fights should be sexy interaction, not hurting each other. There is a rough combat room which you can use for those things.

4: In reference to other players: Respect their kinks, respect their no-list, and respect them. If you aren't certain, check their profile, and don't ever use a derogatory nickname to refer to them (slut, for example) without asking if they are okay with it first. Don't ever assume.

5: No OOC drama. Take it to PMs or the OOC room, don't drag the channel down with it. Show others respect out-of-character (OOC talk should be somehow be marked, like with parenthesis, unless in the OOC room). 

6: Don't spam during matches, use [color=red]!status[/color] to check if a match is going on. Comments about the match are still allowed, but please avoid commands, roleplays or idle chatter while a match is going on.

7: Don't fight in multiple rooms at once, others want to fight too.

8: If someone ends a fight for any reason, that's to be accepted and respected.

9: Trying to go around any timeouts and bans by using the discord server to get access to the room again will result in an perma-ban from the discord channel and all LSW rooms.

10: Mods are not to be put on the ignore list, that is so you can hear their warnings about rule breaking. Doing so will end in an insta-kick and further consequences

[b][color=red]Should any decision of the mod seem unfair the room-owner will make a final decision about it, contact her in that case.[/color][/b]
